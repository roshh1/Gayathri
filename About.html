			<h1 class="heading-font">About Us</h1>
			<p class="para-font">Established in the year 1957 as Gayathri Frame Works, We were one of the premiere 'Start up' to introduce the business of framing to the city of Bangalore. Yes, you read it right! and ever since, we have been a trend setter in the market when it comes to introducing new products, styles or break through designs and innovations inspired from across the world. With the expansion in the later years the retail division of the establishment was rebranded as Gayathri Gallerie in the year 2006.</p> 
			<p class="para-font">Setup shop in the era when Bangalore was a sleepy little hamlet and known as a 'pensioners paradise' or the 'garden city' rather than the glitzy silicon valley it has turned into at present. We have stayed true to the core spirit of the traditional yester-years Bangalore, where quality of craftsmanship takes far more importance than pomp and show. Our showroom still looks the same as it was at its inception, so does the highest level of quality work. Do Mavalli Tiffin Room or Vidhyathi Bhavan ring a bell? </p> 
			<p class="para-font">Ever since the beginning, Gayathri Gallerie has been striving to provide a product that will stand the test of time – keeping up with current trends and fads – by helping our 'Guests' admire and preserve their cherished work of art, photograph, or keepsake for years to come.</p>
			<p class="para-font">With a wide range of products and the services for all your framing needs, We assure you will never be left disappointed!</p>

			<h1 class="heading-font">Our Legacy</h1>
			<p class="para-font">The family business spanning THREE generations was initially founded by Mr. (Late) Ramakrishna Rao who introduced the booming market of frames in Bombay (present day Mumbai) to the city Bengaluru. In those times he had bought the rights of acquiring, framing and distribution of religious pictures for the entire state of Karnataka. He was instrumental in developing the framing industry in Bengaluru and making a name for himself and the brand Gayathri Frame Works. 	</p> 
			<p class="para-font">Mr. Chandrashekar K. R. (s/o Mr. Ramakrishna Rao) started as apprentice of framing at the age of 16 under his father in the year 1974. Ever since, he has gained vast amount of experience while mastering the craft aided by his passion and has upheld the highest traditions of  quality craftsmanship  and providing excellent customer service. Throughout this journey, Gayathri Gallerie has been a learning hallow to many craftsmen who have learnt the trade of framing under him and have setup their own businesses and flourishing in all the corners of the city. Being a technology enthusiast, he has built many tools and machinery related to the craft of framing along with his son. 	</p>
